# This module provides a very simple client interface for suggesting new
# replicated values to one of the servers. No reply is received so an eye must
# be kept on the server output to see if the new suggestion is received. Also,
# when master leases are in use, requests must be sent to the current master
# server. All non-master servers will ignore the requests since they do not have
# the ability to propose new values in the multi-paxos chain.
